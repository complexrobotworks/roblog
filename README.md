## Welcome to the Roblog!

This is a collection of various guides I've put together to accomplish different things. None of this information is unique, per se. It's very readily available anywhere on the 'net (or just ask ChatGPT ðŸ˜œ) - but I'm using this as a way to catalog my experiences in implementing different pieces of infrastructure or code to complete specific tasks. 

Each article will be split out into its own folder with related artifacts so that you can follow along. 

Enjoy!

Upcoming topics (maybe!):

1. Creating a serverless contact form on a static website using AWS Lambda and SES (haven't quite cracked into this yet but found something maybe promising).
2. Hosting WordPress on AWS in a self managed capacity (to be fair, I have no idea what the costs are behind this one, but it's something I've been thinking about looking into).
